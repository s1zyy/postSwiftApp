# üì± PostSwiftApp: Secure iOS Client with RESTful CRUD

**PostSwiftApp** is a robust native iOS application built with **Swift** and **UIKit**, showcasing professional skills in client-server interaction, user authentication, and persistent data storage.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Functionality

This project demonstrates core competencies essential for a professional iOS Developer:

* **Full CRUD Operations:** Seamless creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of post entities via a remote RESTful API.
* **JWT Authentication:** Implementation of a secure user login system, handling **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for protected API routes and session management.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses **Core Data** for efficient local storage and caching of post data, enhancing the user experience and demonstrating robust data management.
* **Networking Layer:** Custom implementation of a dedicated **Service Layer** using native `URLSession` for clean, reusable, and error-handled API calls.
* **Programmatic UI:** User interface built entirely with **UIKit** and **Auto Layout** (without Storyboards), reflecting a modern, code-centric development approach.

## üìê Architecture & Design

| Element | Pattern/Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Architecture** | **MVCS** (Model-View-Controller-Store) | A modular extension of MVC where dedicated **Store/Manager** layers isolate networking, authentication, and data persistence logic, leading to better **Separation of Concerns**. |
| **Networking** | **Generic API Client** | Utilizes **Generics** and `JSONDecoder` to create a type-safe and reusable network client for handling various API response models. |
| **Data Management** | **Core Data Stack** | Demonstrates proficiency in setting up and managing the Core Data stack (NSPersistentContainer, NSManagedObjectContext) for local caching. |
| **Code Style** | **Swift Idioms** | Adherence to modern Swift language idioms, including use of property wrappers, generics, and error handling. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Xcode 14 or newer
* An iOS device or simulator running iOS 14.0 or later

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/s1zyy/postSwiftApp.git](https://github.com/s1zyy/postSwiftApp.git)
    cd postSwiftApp
    ```

2.  **Open the Project in Xcode:**

    ```bash
    xed .
    ```

3.  **Configure API (Important):**
    * This app requires a running backend API. Ensure your backend server (e.g., your `post-api` project) is accessible.
    * You may need to update the base URL constant in the Networking layer (e.g., in a `Constants.swift` file) to point to your local or deployed API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`).

4.  **Build and Run:** Select a simulator and click the "Run" button ($\triangleright$).

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

I plan to continue improving this project by implementing:

* **Comprehensive Testing:** Implementing **Unit and UI Testing** to ensure the reliability of critical paths, such as authentication and all CRUD operations, ensuring code quality and stability.
* **Architecture Refactoring:** Migrating the existing MVC structure to a more testable pattern like **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** to separate the UI logic from the business logic, which is essential for scalable development.
